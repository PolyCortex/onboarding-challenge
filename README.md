The challenge is presented in a jupyter notebook. You must first install Python 3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Afterwards, just run the following command to install all required packages.

>Â pip install -r requirements.txt

You will then be able to start a new jupyter kernel with the following command.

You can now open the `onboarding-challenge` notebook inside you browser and start experimenting.

## Common issues

If you encounter issues regarding the connexion of the Muse headband, please refer to the [muse-lsl guide](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl). You also have to make sure your bluetooth drivers are up to date (i.e. [bluez drivers](https://docs.ubuntu.com/core/en/stacks/bluetooth/bluez/docs/) if you are using linux). If you are working with Mac, a dongle is required to connect the Muse.
